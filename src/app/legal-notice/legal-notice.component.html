      <p><em>[additional list items]</em></p>

      <p>Free website terms and conditions: drafting notes</p>

      <p>
        This is a free version of our standard website terms and conditions
        document. It is identical to that document, save that this version
        includes an SEQ legal credit.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to the provisions that would typically be included in any
        set of website terms and conditions, this document includes provisions
        covering user accounts and user-generated content (although the latter
        are not as detailed as in some of our more sophisticated website terms
        and conditions documents).
      </p>

      <p>
        If your website does not feature user accounts or interactive features,
        you may wish to consider our website disclaimer document instead of
        these terms and conditions.
      </p>

      <p>Section 1: Introduction</p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, there will be a contractual relationship between a website
        operator and a website user; other times, there will not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where there is no contractual relationship, legal notices can still have
        legal effects. For instance, licences of intellectual property rights
        and disclaimers of liability may be legally effective where there is no
        contract. Moreover, statutory and regulatory disclosure obligations can
        be fulfilled by means of legal notices irrespective of whether a
        contract subsists.
      </p>

      <p>
        If however an operator is selling something to users, or wants to impose
        positive obligations upon users, or wants to institute prohibitions that
        are extraneous to any licence of intellectual property rights, a
        contractual relationship will usually be necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        To help ensure that a terms and conditions document is properly
        incorporated into a contract, the document should be expressly accepted
        by the user.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common methods of gaining acceptance include: (a) incorporating a
        statement next to a submit button providing that, by pressing the submit
        button, the user agrees to the document; (b) using a checkbox to gain
        consent, and blocking registration form submission if the checkbox has
        not been checked; and (c) requiring users to scroll through the
        document, and click an "agree" button after doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        In all cases, the document should be available to users at the point of
        acceptance, either on screen or via a hyperlink. If a contractual
        document includes unusual and/or potentially controversial provisions,
        it may be necessary to bring these to the particular attention of users.
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, you should not ask users to affirm that they have actually
        read a legal document - almost none will do so, and the reading of the
        document is not a precondition to its incorporation into the contract.
      </p>

      <p>Section 1.2</p>

      <p>Optional element.</p>

      <p>
        The completed document should be easily accessible on the website, with
        a link from every page.
      </p>

      <p>Section 1.3</p>

      <p>
        Optional element. Will all or any website users give their express
        consent to the terms of this document?
      </p>

      <p>
        Ideally, from a legal perspective, all users would be asked to expressly
        agree to the terms of the document. However, in practice, express
        consent is rarely sought from casual website visitors. On the other
        hand, it is easy to obtain the express consent of users who register
        with the website or submit any material to the website, eg by clicking
        "I accept" on an electronic version of the document. You should retain
        evidence of the acceptance of the document terms by each such user.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under what circumstances will users be asked to give their express
        consent to the terms of this document?
      </p>

      <p>Section 1.4</p>

      <p>
        Optional element. Are there any age restrictions on the use of the
        website?
      </p>

      <p>
        The use of websites by minors can be legally problematic. There are a
        number of different legal issues. For example, under English law,
        contracts may be unenforceable against minors. Another issue concerns
        data protection. The law of data protection imposes additional burdens
        in relation to the processing of any personal data of a minor and
        personal data provided by a minor. The effects of the law of indecency
        may also depend upon whether a website is accessible by minors.
        Obviously, the inclusion of a requirement in your terms and conditions
        that minors refrain from using a website is no guarantee that they will
        do so. Where your website is directed at, or likely to be used by,
        minors, we recommend that you seek specialist legal advice.
      </p>

      <p>What is the minimum age for website users?</p>

      <p>Section 2: Credit</p>

      <p>Section: Free documents licensing warning</p>

      <p>
        Optional element. Although you need to retain the credit, you should
        remove the inline copyright warning from this document before use.
      </p>

      <p>Section 3: Copyright notice</p>

      <p>A copyright notice is an assertion of ownership.</p>

      <p>
        Copyright notices usually take the form specified in Article 3(1) of the
        Universal Copyright Convention (although the UCC itself is now of very
        limited significance):
      </p>

      <p>
        "Any Contracting State which, under its domestic law, requires as a
        condition of copyright, compliance with formalities such as deposit,
        registration, notice, notarial certificates, payment of fees or
        manufacture or publication in that Contracting State, shall regard these
        requirements as satisfied with respect to all works protected in
        accordance with this Convention and first published outside its
        territory and the author of which is not one of its nationals, if from
        the time of the first publication all the copies of the work published
        with the authority of the author or other copyright proprietor bear the
        symbol © accompanied by the name of the copyright proprietor and the
        year of first publication placed in such manner and location as to give
        reasonable notice of claim of copyright."
      </p>

      <p>
        It will be rare for a website owner to be the sole proprietor of all the
        copyright in a website. For example, the software code used to run the
        website may belong to another person. For this reason, the notice here
        refers also to licensors.
      </p>

      </p>

        Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works -
        https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698
      </p>

      <p>Section 3.1</p>

      <p>
        What was the year of first publication of the relevant copyright
        material (or the range of years)?
      </p>

      <p>Who is the principal owner of copyright in the website?</p>

      <p>Section 4: Permission to use website</p>

      <p>
        Every website is a compendium of copyright-protected works. These may
        include literary works, (website text, HTML, CSS and software code),
        graphic works (photographs and illustrations), databases, sound
        recordings and films.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most fundamental principle of copyright law is that a person may not
        copy a protected work without permission. Using a website involves
        copying some or all of the works comprised in the website. Accordingly,
        a user needs permission to use a website. A "licence" is just such a
        permission.
      </p>

      <p>
        In most if not all cases, by publishing a website a person will be
        granting an implied licence to website visitors to copy of the website.
        The problem with an implied licence is that the scope of the licence is
        inherently uncertain. Is the visitor permitted to download the entire
        website? Is the visitor permitted to reproduce elements of the website
        elsewhere?
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of this uncertainty, most publishers will include an express
        licence setting out exactly what visitors are permitted to do in
        relation to a website and, just as important, what they are not
        permitted to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scope of the licence will vary. In editing these provisions,
        consider carefully exactly what your users should be allowed to do with
        the website and material on the website.

      <p>Section 11.2</p>

      <p>Optional element.</p>

      <p>Section 12: Limitations and exclusions of liability</p>

      <p>
        Contractual limitations and exclusions of liability are regulated and
        controlled by law, and the courts may rule that particular limitations
        and exclusions of liability in contracts are unenforceable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The courts are particularly likely to intervene where a party is seeking
        to rely on a limitation or exclusion of liability in its standard terms
        and conditions, but will also sometimes intervene where a term has been
        individually negotiated.&nbsp;The courts may be more likely to rule that
        provisions excluding liability, as opposed to those merely limiting
        liability, are unenforceable.&nbsp;If there is a risk that any
        particular limitation or exclusion of liability will be found to be
        unenforceable by the courts, that provision should be drafted as an
        independent term, and be numbered separately from the other
        provisions.&nbsp;It may improve the chances of a limitation or exclusion
        of liability being found to be enforceable if the party seeking to rely
        upon it specifically drew it to the attention of the other party before
        the contract was entered into.
      </p>

      <p>
        Exclusions and limitations of liability in UK contracts are primarily
        regulated by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 ("UCTA").&nbsp;Contracts
        regulated by UCTA cannot exclude or restrict a party's liability for
        death or personal injury resulting from negligence (Section 2(1),
        UCTA).&nbsp;Except insofar as the relevant term satisfies the
        requirements of reasonableness, such contracts cannot exclude or
        restrict liability: (i) for negligence (which includes a breach of an
        express or implied contractual obligation to take reasonable care or
        exercise reasonable skill) (Section 2(2), UCTA); or (ii) for
        misrepresentation (Section 3, Misrepresentation Act 1967).&nbsp;In
        addition, if a contract is regulated by UCTA, and one of the parties is
        dealing on the other's written standard terms of business, then except
        insofar as the relevant contractual term satisfies the requirements of
        reasonableness the other party cannot: (i) exclude or restrict his
        liability in respect of a breach of contract; or (ii) claim to be
        entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different
        from that which was reasonably expected of him; or (iii) claim to be
        entitled, in respect of the whole or any part of his contractual
        obligation, to render no contractual performance at all (see Section 3,
        UCTA).&nbsp;UCTA includes various other restrictions, particularly in
        the case of contracts for the sale of goods and contracts under which
        possession or ownership of goods passes.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you wish to try to limit/exclude for liability in respect of
        reckless, deliberate, personal and/or repudiatory breaches of contract,
        you may wish to specify this in relation to the relevant provision (for
        example, using the following wording: "The limitations and exclusions of
        liability in this Clause [number] will apply whether or not the
        liability in question arises out of any reckless, deliberate, personal
        and/or repudiatory conduct or breach of contract").
      </p>

      <p>
        Somewhat different rules apply to limitations of liability in contracts
        with consumers, and these provisions should not be used in relation to
        such contracts.
      </p>

      <p>
        These guidance notes provide a very incomplete and basic overview of a
        complex subject. Accordingly, you should take legal advice if you may
        wish to rely upon a limitation or exclusion of liability.

      <p>Section 12.1</p>

      <p>
        Do not delete this provision (except upon legal advice). Without this
        provision, the specific limitations and exclusions of liability in the
        document are more likely to be unenforceable.
      </p>

      <p>Section 12.3</p>

      <p>
        Optional element. Do you want to attempt to exclude all liability for
        free services and information?
      </p>

      <p>
        This sort of exclusion is quite common, but unlikely to be enforceable
        in court.
      </p>

      <p>Section 12.5</p>

      <p>Optional element.</p>

      <p>Section 12.6</p>

      <p>Optional element.</p>

      <p>Section 12.8</p>

      <p>
        Optional element. If the website operator is a limited liability entity
        (eg a limited company), do you want to expressly exclude liability on
        the part of officers and employees?
      </p>

      <p>Section 13: Breaches of these terms and conditions</p>

      <p>Section 13.1</p>

      <p>Will account suspension or deletion be a possibility here?</p>

      <p>Section 13.2</p>

      <p>Optional element.</p>

      <p>Do you wish to specify types of action that are prohibited here?</p>

      <p>Detail the types of action which are prohibited by this provision.</p>

      <p>Section 14: Variation</p>

      <p>
        Changes to legal documents published on a website will not generally be
        retrospectively effective, and variations without notice to and/or
        consent from relevant users may be ineffective.
      </p>

      <p>Section 14.2</p>

      <p>Will website users be notified of changes to the document?</p>

      <p>Section 14.3</p>

      <p>
        Optional element. Will registered users be required to consent to
        variations?
      </p>

      <p>Section 17: Third party rights</p>

      <p>Optional element.</p>

      <p>
        This provision is designed to exclude any rights a third party may have
        under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

      <p>Section 18.1</p>

      <p>What other documents govern the use of the website?</p>

      <p>Section 19: Law and jurisdiction</p>

      <p>
        The questions of which law governs a document and where disputes
        relating to the document may be litigated are two distinct questions.
      </p>

      <p>Section 19.1</p>

      <p>
        This document has been drafted to comply with English law, and the
        governing law provision should not be changed without obtaining expert
        advice from a lawyer qualified in the appropriate jurisdiction. In some
        circumstances the courts will apply provisions of their local law, such
        as local competition law or consumer protection law, irrespective of a
        choice of law clause.
      </p>

      <p>Which law should govern the document?</p>

      <p>Section 19.2</p>

      <p>
        In some circumstances your jurisdiction clause may be overridden by the
        courts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Should the jurisdiction granted be exclusive or non-exclusive? Choose
        "non-exclusive" jurisdiction if you may want to enforce the terms and
        conditions against users outside England and Wales. Otherwise, choose
        "exclusive jurisdiction".
      </p>

      <p>
        The courts of which country or jurisdiction should adjudicate disputes
        under the document?
      </p>

      <p>Section 20: Statutory and regulatory disclosures</p>

      <p>
        Do the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 apply to the
        website or is the website operator registered for VAT?
      </p>

      <p>
        This section can be deleted where website operator is not registered for
        VAT and the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 do not
        apply. Generally, those Regulations will apply unless a website is
        entirely non-commercial, ie where a website does not offer any goods or
        services and does not involve any remuneration (which includes
        remuneration for carrying AdSense or other advertising).

        profession (eg solicitors)?
      </p>

      <p>
        The Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 provide that if
        "the service provider exercises a regulated profession", it must provide
        "(i) the details of any professional body or similar institution with
        which the service provider is registered; (ii) his professional title

      <p>
        All services covered by the Ecommerce Directive (which was implemented
        in the UK through the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations
        2002) must provide a name, a geographic address (not a P.O. Box number)
        and an email address.

        names, their registration numbers, their place of registration and their
        registered office address on their websites (although not necessarily in
        this document). Sole traders and partnerships that carry on a business
        in the UK under a "business name" (i.e. a name which is not the name of
        the trader/names of the partners or certain other specified classes of
        name) must also make certain additional disclosures: (a) in the case of
        a sole trader, the individual's name; (b) in the case of a partnership,
        the name of each member of the partnership; and (c) in either case, in
        relation to each person named, an address in the UK at which service of
